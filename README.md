This is a repository where I will be keeping track of different CodeWar challenges and the solutions I have come up with to solve for each challenge. I am currently testing my abilities in the JavaScript section and studying under the most basic level.

1.Invert values

Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.

invert([1,2,3,4,5]) == [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]
invert([1,-2,3,-4,5]) == [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
invert([]) == []
You can assume that all values are integers. Do not mutate the input array/list.

2. A Needle In The Haystack

Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

Example(Input --> Output)

["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] --> "found the needle at position 5" 
Note: In COBOL, it should return "found the needle at position 6"

3. Convert Boolean Values to "Yes" or "No"
Complete the method that takes a boolean value and return a "Yes" string for true, or a "No" string for false.
