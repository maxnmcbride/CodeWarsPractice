This is a repository where I will be keeping track of different CodeWar challenges and the solutions I have come up with to solve for each challenge. I am currently testing my abilities in the JavaScript and Ruby sections, studying at the most basic level.

JavaScript

1.Invert values

Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.

invert([1,2,3,4,5]) == [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]
invert([1,-2,3,-4,5]) == [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
invert([]) == []
You can assume that all values are integers. Do not mutate the input array/list.

2. A Needle In The Haystack

Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

Example(Input --> Output)

["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] --> "found the needle at position 5" 
Note: In COBOL, it should return "found the needle at position 6"

3. Convert Boolean Values to "Yes" or "No"

Complete the method that takes a boolean value and return a "Yes" string for true, or a "No" string for false.

4.Summation

Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

For example (Input -> Output):

2 -> 3 (1 + 2)
8 -> 36 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8)

5. Rock Paper Scissors

Let's play! You have to return which player won! In case of a draw return Draw!.

Examples(Input1, Input2 --> Output):

"scissors", "paper" --> "Player 1 won!"
"scissors", "rock" --> "Player 2 won!"
"paper", "paper" --> "Draw!"

6. String Repeat

Write a function that accepts an integer n and a string s as parameters, and returns a string of s repeated exactly n times.

Examples (input -> output)
6, "I"     -> "IIIIII"
5, "Hello" -> "HelloHelloHelloHelloHello"

7.Function 1 - Hello World

Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

Style Points
Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative "hello world" you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?

8. MakeUpperCase

Write a function which converts the input string to uppercase.

9. Thinkful Logic Drills - Traffic Lights

You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.

For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.

10. Convert a Number to a String

We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.

What ways of achieving this do you know?

Examples (input --> output):
123  --> "123"
999  --> "999"
-100 --> "-100"

11. You Can't Code Under Pressure

Code as fast as you can! You need to double the integer and return it.

12. How good are you really?

There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!
But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.

You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the average and compare your score!

Return True if you're better, else False!

Note:
Your points are not included in the array of your class's points. For calculating the average point you may add your point to the given array!

13. You Only Need One - Beginner

You will be given an array a and a value x. All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value.

Array can contain numbers or strings. X can be either.

Return true if the array contains the value, false if not.

14. Opposites Attract

Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

15. Calculate Average

Write a function which calculates the average of the numbers in a given list.

Note: Empty arrays should return 0.

16. Reversed Sequence

Build a function that returns an array of integers from n to 1 where n>0.

Example : n=5 --> [5,4,3,2,1]

17. Return Negative

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

18. Opposite Number

Very simple, given an integer or a floating-point number, find its opposite.

19. Beginner - Reduce but Grow

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the result of multiplying the values together in order. Example:

[1, 2, 3, 4] => 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24

20. Simple multiplication
This kata is about multiplying a given number by eight if it is an even number and by nine otherwise.

1. Detect Pangram

A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.

2. Beginner Series #1 School Paperwork

Your classmates asked you to copy some paperwork for them. You know that there are 'n' classmates and the paperwork has 'm' pages.

Your task is to calculate how many blank pages do you need. If n < 0 or m < 0 return 0.

Example:
n= 5, m=5: 25
n=-5, m=5:  0

 3.Find Maximum and Minimum Values of a List

 Your task is to make two functions ( max and min, or maximum and minimum, etc., depending on the language ) that receive a list of integers as input, and return the largest and lowest number in that list, respectively.

Examples (Input -> Output)
* [4,6,2,1,9,63,-134,566]         -> max = 566, min = -134
* [-52, 56, 30, 29, -54, 0, -110] -> min = -110, max = 56
* [42, 54, 65, 87, 0]             -> min = 0, max = 87
* [5]                             -> min = 5, max = 5

4. Abbreviate a Two Word Name

Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.

The output should be two capital letters with a dot separating them.

It should look like this:

Sam Harris => S.H

patrick feeney => P.F

5. Sum Mixed Array

Given an array of integers as strings and numbers, return the sum of the array values as if all were numbers.

Return your answer as a number.

6. Even or Odd

Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

7. Find the smallest integer in the array

Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.

For example:

Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345
You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.

8. Basic Mathematical Operations

Your task is to create a function that does four basic mathematical operations.

The function should take three arguments - operation(string/char), value1(number), value2(number).
The function should return result of numbers after applying the chosen operation.

Examples(Operator, value1, value2) --> output
('+', 4, 7) --> 11
('-', 15, 18) --> -3
('*', 5, 5) --> 25
('/', 49, 7) --> 7

9. Convert a string to an array

Write a function to split a string and convert it into an array of words.

Examples (Input ==> Output):
"Robin Singh" ==> ["Robin", "Singh"]

"I love arrays they are my favorite" ==> ["I", "love", "arrays", "they", "are", "my", "favorite"]

10. Fake Binary

Given a string of digits, you should replace any digit below 5 with '0' and any digit 5 and above with '1'. Return the resulting string.

Note: input will never be an empty string

11. Convert a String to a Number!

Description
We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?

Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.

12. Is it a palindrome?

Write a function that checks if a given string (case insensitive) is a palindrome.
