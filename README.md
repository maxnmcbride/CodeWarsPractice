This is a repository where I will be keeping track of different CodeWar challenges and the solutions I have come up with to solve for each challenge. I am currently testing my abilities in the JavaScript section and studying under the most basic level.

1.Invert values

Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.

invert([1,2,3,4,5]) == [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]
invert([1,-2,3,-4,5]) == [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
invert([]) == []
You can assume that all values are integers. Do not mutate the input array/list.

2. A Needle In The Haystack

Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

Example(Input --> Output)

["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] --> "found the needle at position 5" 
Note: In COBOL, it should return "found the needle at position 6"

3. Convert Boolean Values to "Yes" or "No"

Complete the method that takes a boolean value and return a "Yes" string for true, or a "No" string for false.

4.Summation

Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

For example (Input -> Output):

2 -> 3 (1 + 2)
8 -> 36 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8)

5. Rock Paper Scissors

Let's play! You have to return which player won! In case of a draw return Draw!.

Examples(Input1, Input2 --> Output):

"scissors", "paper" --> "Player 1 won!"
"scissors", "rock" --> "Player 2 won!"
"paper", "paper" --> "Draw!"

6. String Repeat

Write a function that accepts an integer n and a string s as parameters, and returns a string of s repeated exactly n times.

Examples (input -> output)
6, "I"     -> "IIIIII"
5, "Hello" -> "HelloHelloHelloHelloHello"

7.Function 1 - Hello World

Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

Style Points
Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative "hello world" you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?

8. MakeUpperCase

Write a function which converts the input string to uppercase.

9. Thinkful Logic Drills - Traffic Lights

You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.

For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.

10. Convert a Number to a String

We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.

What ways of achieving this do you know?

Examples (input --> output):
123  --> "123"
999  --> "999"
-100 --> "-100"

11. You Can't Code Under Pressure

Code as fast as you can! You need to double the integer and return it.

12. How good are you really?

There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!
But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.

You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the average and compare your score!

Return True if you're better, else False!

Note:
Your points are not included in the array of your class's points. For calculating the average point you may add your point to the given array!

13. You Only Need One - Beginner

You will be given an array a and a value x. All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value.

Array can contain numbers or strings. X can be either.

Return true if the array contains the value, false if not.

14. Opposites Attract

Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

15. Calculate Average

Write a function which calculates the average of the numbers in a given list.

Note: Empty arrays should return 0.

16. Reversed Sequence

Build a function that returns an array of integers from n to 1 where n>0.

Example : n=5 --> [5,4,3,2,1]

17. Return Negative

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

18. Number of People in the Bus

There is a bus moving in the city which takes and drops some people at each bus stop.

You are provided with a list (or array) of integer pairs. Elements of each pair represent the number of people that get on the bus (the first item) and the number of people that get off the bus (the second item) at a bus stop.

Your task is to return the number of people who are still on the bus after the last bus stop (after the last array). Even though it is the last bus stop, the bus might not be empty and some people might still be inside the bus, they are probably sleeping there :D

Take a look on the test cases.

Please keep in mind that the test cases ensure that the number of people in the bus is always >= 0. So the returned integer can't be negative.

The second value in the first pair in the array is 0, since the bus is empty in the first bus stop.
