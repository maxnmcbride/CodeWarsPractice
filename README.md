This is a repository where I will be keeping track of different CodeWar challenges and the solutions I have come up with to solve for each challenge. I am currently testing my abilities in the JavaScript section and studying under the most basic level.

1.Invert values

Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.

invert([1,2,3,4,5]) == [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]
invert([1,-2,3,-4,5]) == [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
invert([]) == []
You can assume that all values are integers. Do not mutate the input array/list.
